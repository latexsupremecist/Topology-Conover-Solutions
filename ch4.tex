\subsection{Exercise 2.6}

\question{Let $X$ be a set. Verify that the indiscrete topology, the discrete topology and the finite-complement topology are in fact topologies on $X$.}

\begin{solution}
 \\Indiscrete Topology: \\
 $\emptyset$ and $X$ are open sets, and any intersection/union of open sets are obviously either empty of $X$. \\
 Discrete Topology: \\
 $\emptyset$ and $X$ are open sets. Since any subset is open, any intersection/union of open sets must be a subset, and hence is open. \\
 Finite-complement Topology: \\
 $\empty set$ and $X$ are open sets. Let $A_i$ denote open sets. Then $X - \bigcup_i A_i \subseteq X - A_i$, where $X - A_i$ has a finite cardinality by definition. Therefore, $X - \bigcup_i A_i$ also has a finite cardinality, so $\bigcup_i A_i$ is open. Now let $B_i$ denote finitely many open sets. $X-B_i$ is finite, and so is $\bigcup_i (X - B_i)$ (finite union of finite sets is finite). Since $\bigcup_i (X - B_i) = X - \bigcap_i B_i$ which is finite, $\bigcap_i B_i$ is an open set.
\end{solution}

\question

\begin{parts}
 
 \part{Verify that Sierpinski space is a topological space.}
 
 
\begin{solution}
It contains $\emptyset$ and $X$. Since there are only 3 open sets, brute forcing through all possible unions/intersections show that they are also open sets.
\end{solution}

\part{We said that there are only three different topologies that can be assigned to the 2 point set $\{0,1\}$.  Is the collection of $\{\emptyset, \{1\},\{0,1\}\}$ one of those three topologies on $\{0,1\}$?}

\begin{solution}
 Yes. The same approach for (a) can be used here, since this is essentially the Sierpinski space with 0 and 1 reversed.
\end{solution}

\part{What is $\{0,1\}$ with the finite-complement topology?}

\begin{solution}
 $\{\emptyset, \{0\}, \{1,\}, \{0,1\}\}$
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question{List all topologies that can be assigned to a 3 point set.}

\begin{solution}
 \\$\{\emptyset, \{0,1,2\}\}$ \\
 $\{\emptyset, \{0\}, \{0,1,2\}\}$ \\
 $\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{0,1,2\}\}$ \\
 $\{\emptyset, \{2\}, \{0,1,2\}\}$ \\
 $\{\emptyset, \{0,1\}, \{0,1,2\}\}$ \\
 $\{\emptyset, \{0,2\}, \{0,1,2\}\}$ \\
 $\{\emptyset, \{1,2\}, \{0,1,2\}\}$ \\
 $\{\emptyset, \{0\}, \{0,1\}, \{0,1,2\}\}$ \\

\question{Verify that the Sorgenfrey topology defined on the real line is in fact a topology. Is the interval $(0,1)$ open in this topology? How about $(0,1]$? Is $[0,1]$ closed?}

\begin{solution}
 \\The Sorgenfrey topology obviously contains $\emptyset$ and $\R$. Let $A_i$ denote open sets. Then
 $$\forall x \in \bigcup_i A_i, x \in A_i \Rightarrow x \in [a,b) \subseteq A_i \subseteq \bigcup_i A_i$$
 so any union of open sets is open. Now let $B_i$ denote finitely many open sets. Now if $x \in B_i$, we let $\{p_i,q_i\} \subset \R$ such that $x \in [p_i,q_i) \subseteq B_i$. Let $P = \{p_i\}$ and $Q = \{q_i\}$. Since both $P$ and $Q$ are finite, $P$ has a maximum $p$ and $Q$ has a minimum $Q$.
 Now
 $$x \in \bigcap_i B_i \Rightarrow x \in [p,q) \subseteq [p_i,q_i) \subseteq B_i \forall i$$
 Since $[p,q)$ is a subset of $B_i \forall i$, it is a subset of $\bigcap_i B_i$, hence any finite intersection of open sets is open. This shows that the Sorgenfrey topology is a topology. \\
 $(0,1)$ is open, because
 $$\forall x \in (0,1), x \in [x,1) \subset (0,1)$$
 $(0,1]$ is not open, because $1 \in (0,1]$, but if $1 \in [a,b)$, then $\frac{1+b}{2}$ is an element of $[a,b)$ but not $(0,1]$, so $1 \in [a,b) \subseteq (0,1]$ cannot be true. \\
 Consider $A = \R - [0,1]$ and let $x \in A$. Either $x < 0$, and $x \in [x,\frac{x}{2}) \subset A$, or $x > 1$, and $x \in [x,x+1)$. Therefore, $A$ is open, so $[0,1]$ is closed.
