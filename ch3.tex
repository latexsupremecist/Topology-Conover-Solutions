\section{Some Familiar Topological Spaces and Basic Topological Concepts}

\subsection{Exercises 1.2}


\question{Let $A = (0,1) \cup (1,3)$. For the given $x \in A$, give a value of $r > 0$ such that $(x-r, x+r) \subseteq A$.}

\begin{parts}
 
 \part{$x = \frac{3}{4}$}
 \part{$x = 2$}
 \part{$x = \frac{9}{8}$}
 
\begin{solution}
 $\frac{1}{16}$
\end{solution}

\end{parts}

\question{Prove that A = $(0,1) \cup (1,3)$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$.}

\begin{solution}
\\Case 1: $x \in (0,1)$ \\
Let $d = \text{min}\{1-x,x\}$. $(x-\frac{d}{2},x+\frac{d}{2}) \subseteq A$ is an open set. \\
Case 2: $x \in (1,3)$ \\
Let $d = \text{min}\{3-x,x-1\}$. The proof proceeds similarly as Case 1. \\
As $\forall x \in A \exists$ an open interval $\subseteq A$ which contains $x$, $A$ is an open set by definition.
\end{solution}

\question{Prove than an ordinary open interval is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ but that an open set need \textit{not} be an open interval.}

\begin{solution}
 \\All open intervals are open subsets: \\
 Replace 0 with $x-r$ and 1 with $x+r$ as in Case 1 from the question above. \\
 Open sets need not be an open interval: \\
 The empty set is an open set, but no open interval is empty, as it contains $x$ (open intervals are in the form $(x-r,x+r)$).
\end{solution}

\question{State precisely what it means when a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is \textit{not} open.}

\begin{solution}
 $\exists x \in A$ such that $(x-r,x+r)-A \neq \emptyset \forall r > 0$
\end{solution}

\question{Prove that the following subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are not open.}

\begin{parts}
 
 \part{The set of rational numbers}
 
 
\begin{solution}
 \\An open interval is nonempty. As it is an open set, it cannot contain a single point only (next question) so it must contain at least 2 points. WLOG, let the 2 points be $p < q$. Using limits, $\exists n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $r = p + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{n} < q$. Since all open intervals contain an irrational $r$, no open intervals can be a subset of the rationals, hence it is not open.
\end{solution}

 \part{A set consisting of a single point}
 
 
\begin{solution}
 \\$\forall$ open intervals $(x-r,x+r)$, it contains the distinct points $x$ and $x+\frac{r}{2}$. Therefore, $\{x\}$ cannot be open.
\end{solution}

 \part{An interval of the form $[a,b)$, where $a < b$}
 
 
\begin{solution}
\\ $\forall$ open intervals $(a-r,a+r)$, $b=a-\frac{r}{2}$ is a point in that interval which is outside of $[a,b)$.
\end{solution}

 \part{The set $A = \{x\in\mathbb{R}:x\neq\frac{1}{n},\text{ for }n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\}$}
 
 
\begin{solution}
\\ $\frac{1}{n}$ tends to 0. Therefore $\forall r > 0 \exists n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $r > \frac{1}{n}$. Therefore all open intervals $(0-r,0+r)$ contains a point outside of $A$.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\subsection{Theorem 1.3}

\question

\begin{parts}
 
 \part{The union of any collection of open subsets of the real line is also an open subset of the line}
 
 
\begin{solution}
 \\ Let $\bigcup A$ denote the union of subsets $A$. Then
$$x \in \bigcup A \Rightarrow x \in A \Rightarrow x \in (x-r,x+r) \subseteq A \subseteq \bigcup A$$
for some $r > 0$. \\
As all points in $\bigcup A$ are in open intervals which are subsets of $\bigcup A$, the union is open by definition.
\end{solution}

\part{The intersection of any finite collection of open subsets of the real line is also an open subset of the line.}

\begin{solution}
 \\This can be proven with induction. \\
Let $A$ and $B$ be open sets. $x \in A \cap B \Rightarrow x \in A$. Since $A$ is open, $\exists r_A > 0$ such that
$$x \in (x-r_A,x+r_A) \subseteq A$$
The same holds for $B$. Letting $r = \text{min}\{r_A,r_B\}$,
$$x \in (x-r,x+r) \subseteq A \cap B \forall x \in A \cap B$$
The same proof is used for the base case and the induction step.
\end{solution}

\part{Both the empty set and $\mathbb{R}$ itself are open subsets of the real line.}

\begin{solution}
 \\Empty set: \\
 $$a \Rightarrow b$$
 is defined to be true when $a$ is false. The definition of an open set $A$ involves the assumption $x \in A$, which is false, so it is vacuously true for the empty set. \\
 $\mathbb{R}$: \\
 $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, (x-1,x+1) \in \mathbb{R}$
\end{solution}

\end{parts}

\subsection{Exercise 1.4}

\question{Give an example of an infinite collection of open subsets of the real line whose intersection is not open, thus showing that the finiteness condition in Theorem 1.3(b) is necessary.}

\begin{solution}
 $$\bigcap A \text{ where } A = \{(-r,r)|r>0\}$$
 Obviously $0 \in (-r,r) \forall r > 0$. However, the intersection does not contain any nonzero element, because $\forall x \neq 0$,
 $$x \notin \{-\frac{|x|}{2},\frac{|x|}{2}\}$$
 The open intervals that form the intersection are open sets, but the intersection contains only 1 element, so it is not open.
\end{solution}

\subsection{Theorem 1.6}

\question

\begin{parts}
 
 \part{The intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed.}
 
 
\begin{solution}
 \\Let $C_i$ be a closed set, and the corresponding open set be defined as $O_i = \mathbb{R} - C_i$.
 
 $$\bigcap_{i \in I} C_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} \mathbb{R} - O_i = R - \bigcup_{i \in I} O_i$$
 
 $\bigcup_{i\in I}O_i$ is a union of open sets, so it is open. Hence its complement (intersection of closed sets) is closed.
\end{solution}

\part{The union of any finite collection of closed sets is closed.}

\begin{solution}
 
 $$\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} C_n =  \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{R} - O_n = R - \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} O_n$$
 
 And the proof follows similar to the case above.
\end{solution}

\part{$\emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}$ itself are both closed}

\begin{solution}
 Their complements are each other, which are open.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\subsection{Exercise 1.7}

\question{State precisely what it means when a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is not closed. (Do this in term of points; saying that a set is not closed if its complement is not open is true, but is not what we want here.}

\begin{solution}
 \\Let that subset be $A$. It is not closed when there is a point outside of it whose every open interval intersects with $A$.
 
 $$\exists x \in \mathbb{R} - A \text{ such that } (x-r,x+r) \cap A \neq \emptyset \forall r > 0$$
\end{solution}

\question{Which of the following subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are closed? Which are open?}

\begin{parts}
 
 \part{The set $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers.}
 \part{The set of rational numbers.}
 \part{A set consisting of a single point.}
 \part{An interval of the form $[a,b)$, where $a < b$.}
 \part{The set $A = \{x\in\mathbb{R}: x \neq \frac{1}{n} \text{ for } n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\}$.}
 \part{The set $A = \{x\in\mathbb{R}: x \neq \frac{1}{n} \text{ for } n \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \text{ and } x \neq 0\}$.}
 
 
\begin{solution}
 \\Closed: a, c \\
 Open: f
\end{solution}

\end{parts}

\question{Prove that an ordinary closed interval is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$, but a closed set need not be a closed interval.}

\begin{solution}
 \\Let the closed interval be $[a,b]$, where $a < b$. We want to prove that its complement is open. Let $x < a$ be in its complement. Then
 $$(x-r,x+r) \text{ where } r = \frac{a-x}{2}$$
 is an open interval in its complement. A similar open interval can be deduced for $x > b$. Therefore, the complement is open, and the closed interval is closed. \\
 For the second part of the question, note that $\mathbb{R}$ is closed, but is not a closed interval. (Or else, let $\mathbb{R} = [a,b]$, and $\mathbb{R}-[a,b] \neq \emptyset$ forms a contradiction.)
\end{solution}

\question{Give an example of an infinite collection of closed subsets of whose union is not closed, thus showing tht the finiteness condition in theorem 1.6(b) is not necessary.}

\begin{solution}
 \\Let the collection be
 $$A = \{[-r,r]|0<r<1\}$$
 It is obvious that $\bigcup A = (-1,1)$. The complement of $(-1,1)$ contains 1, whose every open interval intersects with $(-1,1)$. Hence the complement is not open, so $\bigcup A$ is not closed.
\end{solution}
